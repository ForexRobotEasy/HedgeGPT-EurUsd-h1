## Description

The HedgeGPT EurUsd h1 code is designed to analyze the EUR/USD currency pair and generate trading predictions based on technical analysis. It utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

The code performs the following functions:

1. Currency Pair Analysis: Retrieves historical data for the EUR/USD currency pair and performs technical analysis to identify potential trading opportunities.

2. Prediction Generation: Utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to generate predictions for trade entry and exit points. Please note that the specific implementation of AI techniques is not included in this code sample.

3. Risk Management: Sets appropriate stop-loss and take-profit levels based on prediction confidence and utilizes risk-reward ratios to determine optimal trade entry and exit levels.

4. Trade Execution: Executes trades automatically based on the generated predictions. It implements an order management system to handle trade entries and exits, ensuring timely and accurate execution.

5. Performance Monitoring: Tracks the performance of the trading algorithm, generates reports on profitability, win rate, and other key performance metrics, and provides real-time monitoring of trades and account balances.

## Usage

To use this code, you need to have the necessary libraries and classes included. These include:

- `Trade.mqh`: Provides trading-related functions.
- `Series.mqh`: Provides functions for working with time series data.
- `History.mqh`: Provides functions for retrieving historical data.
- `Math.mqh`: Provides mathematical functions.

You can adjust the input parameters to customize the trading strategy. These parameters include:

- `StopLoss`: The stop loss level in pips.
- `TakeProfit`: The take profit level in pips.
- `RiskRewardRatio`: The risk-reward ratio for trade entry and exit.
- `MaxBars`: The maximum number of bars to analyze.
- `ConfidenceLevel`: The minimum confidence level for trade execution.

Once you have set up the necessary libraries and adjusted the input parameters, the code will execute the main program logic in the `OnTick` function. It will perform currency pair analysis, generate predictions, manage risk, execute trades, and monitor performance.

Please note that this code is a sample implementation and may require further customization and refinement to fit your specific trading needs.
